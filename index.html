			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a software engineer and developer advocate at
				<a href="https://dev.to" class="dark-purple">DEV</a>. Before that, I
				was a lead instructor at
				<a href="https://generalassemb.ly" class="red">General Assembly</a>
				teaching their Web Development Immersive for both campus and
				enterprise programs. I currently teach their Python part time class. I
				am one of their distinguished faculty members, part of the Python
				Product Advisory Board, and have been nominated for a GAccolade award.
				Before teaching, I was a software engineer at a startup.
			</p>
			<p>
				I <a href="https://dev.to/aspittel" class="light-purple">blog</a> a
				lot about code and my life as a developer. My blog posts have had over
				900k reads and have been featured on DEV's top 7, the top spot on
				HackerNews, FreeCodeCamp, and in JSWeekly.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm also a director for
				<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/" class="blue">Women Who Code DC</a>, a co-founder
				of
				the
				<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Art-Code-Collective/" class="orange">Art Code Collective</a>, and
				the DC
				Chapter Lead for
				<a href="https://www.meetup.com/VueVixens-DC/" class="green">Vue Vixens</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not coding you can find me watching my favorite New England
				sports teams, taking runs around Capitol Hill with my dog
				<a href="https://www.instagram.com/blairnugget/" class="pink">Blair</a>, or rock climbing.
