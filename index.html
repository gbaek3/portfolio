			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				I am an aspiring Web Developer looking to contribute to the creation of innovative apps.
				I recently graduated from the Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp at Georgia Tech in Spring 2019.
				Concidentally, this wasn't my first trip to Georgia Tech, as it was where I received my Bachelor's
				in Industrial Engineering.
			</p>
			<p>
				My decision to go to Georgia Tech for my Undergrad was a fairly simple one. All my life I've tried doing
				things the "best" or "optimal" way. I would visualize things from a big picture point of view to save
				time, resources, anything really. The mantra of an Industrial Engineer is efficiency and that's how my
				journey led me to the Georgia Institute of Technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				Years after graduating at Georgia Tech, I was working at UPS as an Industrial Engineer. I was trained to
				use SQL to query data necessary for reports. Naturally, learning and using SQL led to other languages,
				such as VBA and JavaScript. This piqued my interest to learn coding and possibly change my career path.
				The biggest source of support came from my brother who believed I could become a great developer; he
				pushed me to pursue my goal and in 2019, I made the leap and enrolled at Georgia Tech once again.
			</p>
			<p>
				From HTML to JavaScript. From JavaScript to MySQL. I learned and developed these skills and much more
				during the GT Boot Camp. But no matter where I end up, my biggest takeaway from this experience is that
				even when facing failure, I can overcome any problem with hard work and determination.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not coding, I try to stay active by playing basketball at the gym or football in the park.
				Bowling is another sport I like to play. A big passion of mine is movies, so I like to watch as many
				as I can, modern or classic.
